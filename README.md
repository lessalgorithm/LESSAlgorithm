# LESSAlgorithm

This project presents the LESS algorithm for promoting energy neutrality in energy harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) delivering services to multiple users. LESS is a lightweight distributed algorithm designed to achieve synergy between applications requirements and Energy-Neutral Operation (ENO) leading to energy-neutral operation of sensors. The approach provides an orchestration framework allowing users to specify application requirements, which are disseminated to sensors to indicate the frequency of sensing and data transmission required by applications. Sensors use the provided specification to determine the duty cycle needed to satisfy the requirements of applications, while still conforming to the constraints of ENO.

A prototype version of LESS is currently available along with a simulator, which allows to evaluate the algorithm for solar, wind and thermal energy sources.
